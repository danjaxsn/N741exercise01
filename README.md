In this repository there are 4 key files:

* this `README.md` file - written in basic `markdown`
* `script1.R` - an R script with some example code to get you started
* `steakSurvey.Rmd` - an initial `rmarkdown` document using the R code from the script to get you started
* `steakSurvey.html` - the resulting HTML file created after processing the `steakSurvey.Rmd` `rmarkdown` file
